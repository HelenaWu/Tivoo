As dramatized in the novel by Chinese Canadian author Zhang Ling, the story shows the pain and resilience of a family decimated by loss, exploring themes of survival, family relationships, guilt and post-traumatic stress. Director Feng paints an emotional epic with potent strokes of truth, bringing to life a new model of disaster cinema that is intimate, choral and uniquely Chinese. -- The highest-grossing domestic film in China's history! -- China's entry for the 2010 foreign-language Oscar! -- Best Film/Best Actor at the 2010 Asia Pacific Screen Awards, Best Actress at the 2010 Asian Film Awards. Part of the Cine-East film series. [Actor Yang Lixin will also visit Duke, on Thu 9/29 - event details TBA.]</p><p>category: Categories: Arts
