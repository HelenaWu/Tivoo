Professor Paul Ekman will deliver the Kenan Distinguished Lecture in Ethics. In 1991, Ekman was awarded the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award, the American Psychological Association's highest award for basic research. In 2001, he was named by the American Psychological Association as one of the most influential psychologists of the 20th century. And in 2009, TIME Magazine listed him as one of the top 100 most influential people of that year. Ekman's work in psychology and facial expression is the basis behind the popular TV show, "Lie to Me." He'll discuss emotion, expression, and deceit.
