Everyday, there are a myriad of hands helping to transform Duke.  These hands nourish students, cut their hair, clean spaces, and build things.  These hands are often invisible in the visible pursuit of higher education. But, without these hands Duke would cease to be. Through black and white photography, Aron Anderson, '10  (Trinity) and W. Edmund Newsome, '11 (Divinity) capture the humanity of those we take for granted. Join us in an exhibit that questions what we take for granted and asks us to celebrate Black people who are "In The Service of Others."</p><p>category: Categories: Arts
